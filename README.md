##Writing Down Your Ideas
 
We all have ideas. With Azure Notebooks, you can write down your ideas using words and pictures, and you can make them come alive with code that you write in Python or R. Azure Notebooks are powered by the Jupyter Open Source project, which currently has over 3 million users.
 
##Sharing Your Ideas
 
Ideas on their own aren't all that useful until you can share them with others. Azure Notebooks makes it easy for you to share your ideas with your colleagues or even with anyone who has access to the web. But we go further than that: we make it easy for them to build their own ideas starting from yours! 
 
When you create and start writing in your notebook, you define an environment that the code in your notebook runs in. When you share your notebook with someone else, they get a copy of the same environment that you were using without needing to install any software on their computer. All they need to do is click on the link that you shared with them and they can immediately start building on top of your idea. 

##About this Repo

This github repo is intended for reporting, discussing, and tracking customer issues. We don't have product code on it yet, but we do have a product roadmap below that we'll keep up-to-date. 

##Product Roadmap - subject to change

The Azure Notebook Service is in public review for the next few quarters. Our focus is key data science scenarios and education. 

**Fall 2016 (Q3-2016)** - Initial preview with basic notebook features and sharing using Libraries.  
**Winter 2016 (Q4-2016)** - Store data files in libraries, import from Github, share private libraries, and add collaborators to libraries.  
**Spring 2017 (Q1-2017)** - More collaboration & security features.
