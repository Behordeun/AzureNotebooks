##Write and Share Your Ideas with Jupyter Notebooks!
 
**Express with Notebooks:** We all have ideas. With Azure Notebooks, you can write down your ideas using words and pictures, and you can make them come alive with code that you write in Python or R. Azure Notebooks are powered by the Jupyter Open Source project, which currently has over 3 million users.

**Share Notebooks:** Azure Notebooks also makes it easy for you to share your ideas with your colleagues or even with anyone who has access to the web. But we go further than that: we make it easy for them to build their own ideas starting from yours! 

##About this Repo

This github repo is intended for reporting, discussing, and tracking customer issues. We don't have product code on it yet, but we do have a product roadmap below that we'll keep up-to-date. 

##Product Roadmap - subject to change

The Azure Notebook Service is in public review for the next few quarters. Our focus is key data science scenarios and education. 

**Fall 2016 (Q3-2016)** - Initial preview with basic notebook features and sharing using Libraries.  
**Winter 2016 (Q4-2016)** - Store data files in libraries, import from Github, private libraries, and collaboration in libraries.  
**Spring 2017 (Q1-2017)** - More collaboration & security features.  

##Try Some Sample Notebooks

Note: you don't need an account to view - click the "eyeball". If you want to run/edit a notebook, you'll need Microsft account (outlook, hotmail, xbox, etc. You'll be prompted to create one)

##FAQs

###What is Jupyter? 

Jupyter (formerly IPython), is a multi-lingual REPL on steroids. This is a free service that provides Jupyter notebooks along with supporting libraries as a service. It means you can just login and use, no installation/setup is necessary. Instructors can also use the service by easily sharing a notebook.  Students get their own private copies that can be run.  The service is provided by the Python team @ Microsoft, which is part of the Data Group.  

###What environemnts are supported and how can I install packages?

Python 2.7.11 (Anaconda 4.1.0) and Python 3.5.1 (Anaconda 4.1).
- You can install packages in Python: `!pip install <pkg name>`
- You can also install packages using conda: '!conda install --name root <pkg name> -y'

We also support R (3.3.0 running MRO)
- You can install packages in R: 'install.packages(â€œpkg
