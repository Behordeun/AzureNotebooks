    "# Discover sentiment in tweets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is commonly used in marketing and customer service to answer questions such as \"Is a product review positive or negative?\" and \"How are customers responding to a product release?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Topic modeling* discovers the abstract topics in a corpus of texts. The results from topic modeling analysis can then be used in sentiment analysis. For example, they can be used to split texts into different subsets and allow us to train a separate sentiment model for each of the subsets. Training separate sentiment models for different subsets can lead to more accurate predictions than using a single model for all the texts. \n",

Here we use only a [160,000 tweet sample](http://azuremlsamples.azureml.net/templatedata/Text%20-%20Input.csv) of that dataset with two fields for each tweet: the polarity of the tweet and the text of the tweet.\n",
